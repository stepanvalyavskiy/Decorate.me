[The main take against EO, which had no answer](https://youtu.be/75U9eefFYoU?t=2498).

Loose translation:

> What simplifies maintainability here if IDEs have completions
with methods and their descriptions,
but if I use small classes, I should learn all existing decorators?

> Very good question. IDEs are to blame
for the convenience of working in a procedural programming style.
Probably after a while IDEs will make some new completions.


The question is unanswered, since
I still don't want to pack dozens of methods
in utility classes only because IDE gives me suggestions and completions.
On the other hand, Developers, including myself,
are so spoiled by good development environments(IDEs)
that they donâ€™t want to give up such powerful features.
Sure, No one wants to manually search for methods that can be called.
Not to mention decorators, which, unlike methods,
can be scattered on the project in a more chaotic order.

It seems like a trade-off - **the uglier the class, the easier it is for us
to work with it in modern IDEs.**

However, there is no place for Tools-Driven Development.
Don't let an IDE decide how your code looks!
Instead, make an IDE work in a way you want.
I offer you a weapon in the struggle for Elegant Objects.
With it, we can elegantly design classes and at the same time
use all the conveniences of modern tools.

**Thus, this plugin is the ultimate answer to this trade-off.**

If you still find the problem a bit abstract and are looking for a
more concrete example, that's [it](https://youtu.be/LPLqLaSwSsI?t=6739).
